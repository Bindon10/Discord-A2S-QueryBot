# Discord-A2S-QueryBot (v2.0.2d)

A lightweight **Steam A2S query bot** for Discord that displays live server info and notifies you when a server goes down.
No plugins, RCON, or server mods required ‚Äî it talks to your game servers the same way the Steam server browser does.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Live Discord embeds**: server name, map, player count, and player list.
- **Optional restart schedule** per server (with local-time display).
- **Down detection + pings** with per-server overrides (`ping_id` or `ping_role_id`).
- **Flexible routing/merging**: same **group + webhook** ‚Üí one message; otherwise separate messages. No ‚ÄúUngrouped‚Äù filler.
- **Per-server-only setup supported**: `DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_URL` can stay `CHANGE_ME` if each server has its own `webhook_url`.
- **Alerts webhook (optional)** for critical errors/warnings (deduped). Falls back to **console** if unset.
- **Message ID resilience**: re-creates missing messages and updates `message_ids.json` automatically.
- **Optional stale cleanup** of message IDs (`STALE_PURGE_ENABLED`).
- **Embed safety**: trims to Discord limits (10 embeds/message, 4096 chars/description) and sanitizes player names.
- **Rate-limit backoff** + **session reuse** for reliable Discord API calls.
- **Graceful shutdown** persists state on exit.
- **Example mode** on first run (no pings until you replace sample config).
- Works with any game that supports **Steam A2S** (Source, GoldSrc, UE servers exposing A2S, etc.).

## üÜï What‚Äôs new in 2.0.3

### Added
- **Hot reload of `servers.json`** (mtime watch). Reloads config without a restart and refreshes `servers.json.bak` after successful load.
- **`.bak` diff cleanup** (on startup & reload):
  - Deletes **route status messages** for routes removed or moved.
  - Clears per-server state for removed servers and deletes any lingering **down-ping** message.
  - **No pings** are sent for manual removals.
- **Webhook allow-list (Discord only):** accepts only `https://` webhooks on `discord.com`, `discordapp.com`, `ptb.discord.com`, `canary.discord.com`. Invalid/placeholder webhooks are skipped and cached IDs pointing to them are pruned.
- **Robust ping addressing:** supports `ping_role_id`, and `ping_id` as `<@123>`, `<@&123>`, or a bare numeric ID, with precise `allowed_mentions`.

### Changed
- **Down/Up lifecycle:**
  - On hitting `DOWN_FAIL_THRESHOLD`, the bot sends **one** down ping and marks the server down.
  - On recovery, it clears down flags, **deletes the down-ping message**, and **recreates the status message** (persisting the new message ID).
- **Route status lifecycle:**
  - If `CLEANUP_REMOVED_ROUTES = true`, routes missing from the current config have their **status messages deleted**.
  - If `DELETE_ON_EMPTY_ROUTES = true`, routes with **no up servers** this cycle have their **status messages deleted** (recreated automatically when a server in the route comes back up).

### Fixed
- **Single ping at threshold:** ping fires exactly when crossing `DOWN_FAIL_THRESHOLD` and won‚Äôt repeat while the server remains down.

### Safety
- **Manual orphan cleanup:** `orphans_to_delete.json` (list of `{webhook_url, message_id}`) is processed on startup to delete known stragglers.

## üì¶ Requirements
- Python **3.9+**
- `python-a2s`
- `requests`
- A Discord **Webhook URL** (at least one ‚Äî either a default or per-server override)

Install deps:
```bash
pip install python-a2s requests
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start
1) **Download** or clone this repo.
2) Open `a2s-status.py`. All user settings are at the **top** under `# === USER CONFIG (edit me) ===`.
3) Pick one of these setups:
   - **Per-server only (recommended for multi-channel):** leave `DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_URL` as `CHANGE_ME`, and put a `webhook_url` on each server in `servers.json`.
   - **Single channel for everything:** set `DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_URL` and omit `webhook_url` on servers you want routed there.
4) **First run**:
```bash
python a2s-status.py
```
On first run the bot creates an example `servers.json`, shows a **yellow** example embed, and **does not ping** anyone until you replace the example.

| `DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_URL` | Fallback webhook for servers without their own `webhook_url`. | Can stay `CHANGE_ME` if you only use per-server webhooks. |
| `ALERTS_WEBHOOK` | Optional webhook for **errors/warnings only**. | Leave empty to log alerts to console. Alerts are de-duplicated. |
| `INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often embeds refresh. | Default `60`.
| `DEFAULT_USER_PING_ID` | Default mention when a server goes down. | Set to `""` to disable default pings. |
| `STEAM_STATUS_CHECK_ENABLED` | Enable Steam backend health gate. | Requires `STEAM_API_KEY` to do anything. |
| `STEAM_API_KEY` | Steam Web API key for outage gating. | See ‚ÄúSteam health gating‚Äù below. |
| `STEAM_STATUS_POLL_SECONDS` | Cache window for Steam health checks. | Default `180`.
| `IGNORED_STEAM_SERVICE_KEYS` | Keys to ignore in Steam health. | Default ignores `IEconItems`.
| `DOWN_FAIL_THRESHOLD` | Consecutive failed polls before a **down** ping. | Default `3`.
| `GROUP_EMBED_LIMIT` | Max embeds per message. | Discord hard cap is 10. |
| `EMBED_DESC_LIMIT` | Max characters in one embed description. | Discord hard cap is 4096. |
| `STALE_PURGE_ENABLED` | Purge obsolete message IDs. | Leave `False` unless you want automatic cleanup. |
| `SHOW_VISIBILITY_BY_DEFAULT` | Shows if a server is password protected | Leave false to hide this information by default. |
| `DEBUG_LOG_ENABLED` | Enables debug logging to file in case of an issue | Defaults to false, messages still log to console. |

## üß© Grouping & routing
- Servers **merge into a single message** only when **both** the `group` **and** the **webhook URL** match.
- If `group` is empty, the server **never merges**; its embed title shows just the server name (no ‚ÄúUngrouped‚Äù).
- If a Discord status **message is deleted**, the bot **re-creates** it and updates `message_ids.json` automatically.
- If a server‚Äôs **webhook changes**, Discord won‚Äôt allow editing the old message via the new webhook. The bot will create a **new** message and track that going forward.
- **Per-server-only setups:** it‚Äôs fine if `DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_URL` is still `CHANGE_ME`. Routes that would rely on the default produce a small **route-scoped** notice and are skipped; everything with a real `webhook_url` works normally.

---

## üîî Pings
- **Default:** uses `DEFAULT_USER_PING_ID` if a server does not specify its own.
- **Per-server user:** set `ping_id` (e.g., `<@123...>`). The bot restricts `allowed_mentions` to that user.
- **Per-server role:** set `ping_role_id` (e.g., `987654...`). The bot will mention that role with safe `allowed_mentions`.
- **Example mode:** pings are **disabled** until you remove the example server(s).

---

## ‚è≥ Restart info
- If `restart: true` and `restart_hour`/`restart_minute` are valid, embeds show:
  `üîÑ Restarts daily at <time> (your local time)`
- If the timezone is invalid, the bot falls back to **UTC**.
- If times are missing/invalid, a friendly warning appears in the embed + a console warning.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safeguards & reliability
- **Rate-limit backoff:** automatic retry on `429` (`Retry-After`) and transient `5xx` with jittered backoff.
- **Session reuse:** persistent `requests.Session` for fewer TCP handshakes.
- **Embed safety:** trims to 10 embeds per message; escape basic Markdown in player names; caps embed description to 4096 chars.
- **Graceful shutdown:** handles SIGINT/SIGTERM and persists state files (`message_ids.json`, `ping_message_ids.json`, `server_down.json`).
- **Stale IDs (optional):** set `STALE_PURGE_ENABLED=True` to auto-remove message IDs that no longer correspond to any configured route. The bot protects expected routes during downtime so it won‚Äôt delete active messages just because servers are temporarily unreachable.

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Steam health gating (optional)
- Set `STEAM_STATUS_CHECK_ENABLED=True` **and** provide `STEAM_API_KEY`.
- When Steam‚Äôs backend looks unhealthy, the bot **freezes downtime counters** and adds a small banner to embeds so you don‚Äôt get false pings.
- Noisy keys (e.g., `IEconItems`) are ignored by default.
- If `STEAM_API_KEY` isn‚Äôt set, the bot **skips** health gating but continues normal operation.

How to get a key:
1. Visit <https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey>
2. Sign in, use any domain (e.g., `localhost`), and copy the key.
3. Paste it into `STEAM_API_KEY` at the top of the script.

## üß∞ Troubleshooting
**‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt it pinging me?‚Äù**
- You‚Äôre still in example mode ‚Äî replace/remove the example server.
- Check the server‚Äôs `ping_id`/`ping_role_id` or the global `DEFAULT_USER_PING_ID`.

**‚ÄúMultiple servers are in one embed when I don‚Äôt want that.‚Äù**
- Give them **different `group` values** (or leave `group` empty for standalone messages).

**‚ÄúIt says restart time not configured/invalid.‚Äù**
- Set `restart_hour` and `restart_minute` and ensure they‚Äôre in valid ranges.
- Verify the timezone; if invalid, the bot will fall back to UTC.

**‚ÄúDEFAULT_WEBHOOK_URL is CHANGE_ME ‚Äî is that OK?‚Äù**
- Yes, if **every server** has its own `webhook_url`. Any route relying on the default will be skipped with a small notice (no spam).

**‚ÄúI changed the webhook and now it doesn‚Äôt update the old message.‚Äù**
- Discord doesn‚Äôt allow editing a message from a **different** webhook. The bot will post a **new** message and track that ID going forward.

**‚ÄúI hit Discord rate limits.‚Äù**
- The bot obeys `Retry-After` and backs off automatically. If you see many rate-limit logs, consider raising `INTERVAL_SECONDS`.
